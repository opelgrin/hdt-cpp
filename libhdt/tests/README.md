# HDT TESTS

## Overview

This folder contains different snippets of code to showcase and test the HDT suite. Some pieces of code could be outdated.

## Compilation

Compile the examples with:

```
$ make check 
```

This command will compile all the (uncommented) programs listed in Makefile.am. If you need to include another one, uncomment or include the name of the program in Makefile.am, and generate again the Makefile with ./autogen.sh and ./configure in the main root path.
